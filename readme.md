# kgen
A Node.js based Command Line Interface for generating KRelay Plugin boilerplate code.

## Installation
To install kgen, 3 other programs are required:
+ [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
+ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
+ [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) _Note: NPM cannot be downloaded on it's own. It is installed when Node.js is installed._

To check if you already have these programs installed or to verify the installation, use the commands:
+ `node -v` to check the version of Node.js installed
+ `npm -v` to check the version of npm installed, and
+ `git -v` to check the version of git installed.

Once Node.js is installed, kgen can be installed in 3 lines:

`git pull https://github.com/thomas-crane/kgen.git`
`cd kgen`
`npm install -g`
